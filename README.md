# UE4-Rayman3Combat-Prototype

**The development is currently paused, until I get feedback from playtesters at my university.**

Remake of the combat system from Rayman 3 in UE4 using blueprints

The prototype currently includes:

- Basic throwing and returning of fist-like projectiles
- Target lock-on
- Sideways strafing
- Launching said projectiles in an arc, depending on strafe direction
- Power-ups:
     - Heavy fist, which doubles damage but lasts for a shorter time
     - Electric fist, which stuns mechanical enemies, but deals less damage overall
- Full level with tutorial, combat arena and platforming section

This prototype was created for the course 'Gameplay Programming' at Hochschule der Medien, Stuttgart
